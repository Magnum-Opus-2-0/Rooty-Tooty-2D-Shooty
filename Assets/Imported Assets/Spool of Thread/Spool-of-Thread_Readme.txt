It has been boned as a figure simply because I use DAZ Studio which can only create figures, not props. The bones are not needed and you may ignore them. The textures were done in DAZ Studio and will likely need to be modified in Poser. The needle has no texture (although it is UV mapped if you wish to apply one), so you can apply a simple silver shader if the texture does not look right in your program. The texture on the thread is achieved via a bump map, so you may need to adjust the bump parameters if it does not look right in your program.The needle, spool, and thread are all separate objects/material zones, so you can turn off any of them if, for example, you needed an empty spool, or only a needle.THESE FILES WERE MADE 100% BY Kethaera.BY PURCHASING THIS PRODUCT YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO USE THESE ELEMENTS IN THE PRODUCTION OF YOUR COMMERCIAL OR NON COMMERCIAL PROJECTS WITHOUT WORRYING ABOUT OBTAINING COPYRIGHT PERMISSION FROM A THIRD PARTY.This set and all the parts remain the property of Kethaera (April Burgess) and may not be used in part or in full in it's ORIGINAL format, in any collection or be claimed as your own.
